### Tropospheric Correction for InSAR using Machine Learning

Developed an atmospheric correction algorithm that utilizes Global weather model data to correct atmospheric effects. To improve prediction resolution by employing deep learning to discover the relationship between weather model delay and interferometric delay, taking into account factors such as temperature, pressure, and water vapor that affect tropospheric interference.

The code will include instruction/script into how to download WM data with RAiDER, GOES, and GNSS stations.
